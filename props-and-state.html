>In your own words, explain the essential differences between props and state in React. Which is immutable or read-only, and which changes? Submit your response in the submission text area and discuss the answer with your mentor. -->

<!-- Props are immutable and read-only. The difference between props and state is that state is managed directly by the component, whereas props are used to pass down data from the view-controller.  -->

<!-- >Read the React official documentation on components and props, and brush up on JavaScript ES6 *classes

Ok. -->

<!-- >Build upon your component from the previous checkpoint's assignment, add in state and props to make sure you have fully mastered these core React properties. -->
